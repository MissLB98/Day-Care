					<img class="principle-pic" src="img/" alt="a picture of the principle"/>
					<p>Working at Red Cross Children’s Hospital for twenty seven years in the Occupational Therapy as an assistant inspired me to improve quality of life in children.</p> 
					<p>It was not just merely a job but a passion that grew stronger, making a difference in young lives by treating children with normal developmental delays and psycho-social development.</p>
					<p>The age groups ranges from 0 – 12 years. The ongoing passion for children inspired me to invest in reaching out to children to experience and gain from my knowledge and skill I have obtained over the years.</p>
					<p>I wanted to invest in the community that I pursue my vision to study further by completing a NQF Level 4 and 5. It is my responsibility reach out to a child and raise up a generation.</p>

				<div class="vision">
					<h1>vision</h1>
					<p>The vision of starting an ECD Centre did not happen overnight as it took ± 6 years ago in planning. To envision it through research and planning deciding the best location and the need in the community.</p> 
					<p>The location is on the main road, accessible and commuter friendly. The centre is situated in the radius of social services, other businesses, library, pharmacy, doctors’ surgery, the police station, bus and taxi terminus/rank. </p>
					<p>Most of the time both parents need to work in today’s society and need a centre to care for their children. Of these parents are employed at these businesses or government institutions. The ECD Centre are able to render a service and employment to the community at hand as the need arise elsewhere.</p> 
					<p>The ECD Centre will encourage and support the empowering individuals working for the centre. These individuals will have to have or the centre’s support to obtain the qualifications, characteristics and passion to work with children at the centre.</p>
					<p>The ECD Centre require excellence in the service rendering to children at all times. The daily programmes provided will be to enrich and build each child’s character and abilities holistically, thriving through learning.</p> 
					<p>The programmes includes social, emotional, physical, morale or spiritual. Successfully failure can be reduced and immediate intervention can be detected and referred for early intervention. It is a home away from home to children to make them feel safe in a happy and relaxing environment.</p>
					<p>The community in the area are family orientated. The ECD Centre will serve and work alongside parents needing its services at prescribed times. The centre will form a special bond/agreement with parents in case of any unforeseen emergencies or circumstances.</p> 
					<p>Parents should feel free to liaise with the centre regarding any concerns or matters at hand. Our doors will be open to accommodate parents in need as far as possible. Parents will participate in the utilisation of the successfulness of the centre.</p>

				<h1>daily programmes</h1>
				<p>Outdoor play times for the children at the ECD centre will preferably differ at times for certain age groups. Younger children will benefit and thrive more freely at their own pace. Whereby older age groups are more energetic and their co- ordination during gross motor activities is controlled faster and balanced.</p>
				<p>Supervised times will be better managed and controlled. The amount of children as well as the outdoor space of the ECD Centre determine the decision to plan the best outcome which will be safest for their children. Please find attached daily programmes indicating the outdoor times.</p>
